#  Inventory Management System

We build an advanced inventory and supplier management platform powered by **Angular**, **MySQL**, and **ZOHO Catalyst's Appsail**. Weâ€™ve also integrated a **Retrieval-Based AI Agent** using **GROUNDX**, capable of extracting intelligent insights from top inventory management literature.

## Live API Base URL

we deployed the backend in cloud using clever cloud MySQL and Zoho's Catalyst hosting ,It can be fetched using  
`https://appsail-50025767379.development.catalystappsail.in/api/ ` as mentioned in `environment.ts` file

> You **do not need to run the backend locally** â€” it's already deployed and ready to use.
